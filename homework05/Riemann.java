// invocation: java Riemann poly 00 8.0 -2.0 1.0 4.0 0.5%

//commandArgs[args.length-1] = optional percentage value --> the two preceding values are the upper and lower bounds
// everything btwn commandArgs[0] & the final 2/3 values will be coefficients of every term of the polynomial
//the number of terms having coefficients is also equal to the order of the polynomial


//in String Class we need a substring Method that can 
//extract the percent value of type double from the last value in the command args
